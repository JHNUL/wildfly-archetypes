WildFly archetype for a subsystem project
-----------------------------------------

[[introduction]]
==== Introduction

This archetype creates a subsystem project.

See https://docs.wildfly.org/26/Extending_WildFly.html

==== Component Dependencies

The versions of all dependencies and plugins that are used by this archetype are configured in the parent's `pom.xml`.

[[build]]
==== Build
To build the archetype, you need at least Java 11. Run this command:
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
$ mvn clean install
----
It will be installed to your local maven repository at "%USERHOME%/.m2/repository/org/wildfly/archetype/wildfly-subsystem/", and an entry will be added to "%USERHOME%/.m2/repository/archetype-catalog.xml".

[[createproject]]
==== Create project from archetype
To create a new project from this archetype, use this maven command (replace dummy values for "groupId", "artifactId", "version", "module" and "package" with correct values):
----
$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.acme -DartifactId=example-subsystem -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT -Dmodule=org.test.subsystem -Dpackage=com.acme.example -DarchetypeGroupId=org.wildfly.archetype -DarchetypeArtifactId=wildfly-subsystem -DarchetypeVersion=30.0.0.Final-SNAPSHOT
----

[[testing]]
==== Test the archetype
After having built the archetype, check whether the subsystem can be loaded in WildFly. This is done by using scripts "runtest.bat" or "runtest.sh" found in the directory "testing".
The scripts require current archetype version as argument.

The script

* creates a project from the subsystem archetype
* adds some debugging code and builds the test project
* copies the resulting subsystem to "%JBOSS_HOME%/modules/system/layers/base"
* starts a local WildFly server
* registers the subsystem using a CLI script
* waits for the user to check that the debugging output of the subsystem was printed
* finally unregisters the subsystem and stops WildFly

Prerequisites

* the environment variable JBOSS_HOME must point to the WildFly server corresponding to the archetyp version.
* Windows: the git tool "patch.exe" must be found in the path
* Linux: "GNU patch" must be installed

See the steps described in "src/main/resources/archetype-resources/Readme.txt"
